<p>With more than 15 years of experience delivering successful software products and solutions in small and large
organizations, I bring a deep understanding of all aspects of software engineering including planning, design, systems
architecture, automated and manual testing, traditional and cloud deployment, and documentation. My responsibilities
have included software development, tools, server environments, and software development processes for both web
(traditional/SaaS/cloud) and embedded software products.</p>
